## Overview

This approach enables Avito to dynamically control screen layouts and content directly from the server, without requiring app updates. It allows for instant A/B testing, personalized user experiences, and rapid deployment of new features or promotional banners. Ultimately, this creates a more agile and data-driven platform that can adapt in real-time to user behavior and market trends.
